<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Almost every week I would be at a loss for what I want to make for dinner. I found this API and decided to use it as my API Capstone for Thinkful. We now use it every week when we're mealplanning. I also wanted to make it easy to find grocery stores for people who might be new to an area.</p>

<h2>Tech used</h2>
<p>HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, Edamam API, Google Maps API</p>
